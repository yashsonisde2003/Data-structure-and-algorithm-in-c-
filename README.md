# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Journey

Welcome to my C++ Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository serves as a diary of my continuous learning process. Here you'll find code implementations, explanations, and examples as I progress through various topics.

## Introduction
This repository is a personal project to document my learning of data structures and algorithms in C++. The goal is to build a solid understanding of these foundational concepts through consistent practice and application.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3. Compile the C++ files:
    ```sh
    g++ filename.cpp -o outputfile
    ```
4. Run the compiled program:
    ```sh
    ./outputfile
    ```

## Daily Learning Log
**Topics Covered**: Arrays, Linked Lists
**Notes**: Implemented basic operations (insertion, deletion) for arrays and singly linked lists.
**Topics Covered**: Stacks, Queues
**Notes**: Explored stack operations using both arrays and linked lists. Implemented queue operations.
**Topics Covered**: Graph Algorithms, Dynamic Programming
**Notes**: Worked on breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms. Started with basic dynamic programming concepts.

## Topics Covered
- **Arrays**: Basics, operations, complexity
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, circular linked lists
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementations and applications
- **Trees**: Binary trees, AVL trees, red-black trees
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort
- **Dynamic Programming**: Basic to advanced problems
- **Miscellaneous**: Hashing, bit manipulation
